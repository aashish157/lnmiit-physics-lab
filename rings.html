                                <p>Fig. 6.1 shows the experimental setup of Newton’s ring. The formation of maximum intensities
                                    at some points and minimum intensities at the other due to the superposition of two
                                    coherent light waves (of same frequencies and constant phase difference) is called interference
                                    of light. The interference fringes are observed as an alternate pattern of bright and
                                    dark fringes. The interference at a point where the intensity of light is maximum, is called
                                    constructive interference (corresponds to bright fringe). For constructive interference, the
                                    two waves should have either same phase or a constant phase difference of</p>(6.1)
                                <p align="center">φ = 2nπ</p>
                                
                                <p>where n = 0, 1, 2, .... Phase difference (φ) and path difference (δ) are related by 
                                        the equation</p>(6.2)
                                     <p align="center">φ = (2π/λ)δ</p>
                                <p>where λ is the wavelength of the incident light. So, for constructive interference the path
                                    difference between the light waves should be</p>(6.3)
                                    <p align="center">δ = nλ</p>
                                       
                                
                                <p>The interference at other point where the intensity of light is minimum, is called destructive
                                    interference (corresponds to dark fringe). For destructive interference, the two waves
                                    should have either same phase or a constant phase difference of</p>(6.4)
                                    <p align="center">φ = (2n + 1)π</p>
                                <p>where n = 0, 1, 2, ... or a constant path difference of</p>(6.5)
                                <p align="center">δ = (2n + 1)λ/2</p>
                                <p> Interference fringes are obtained by dividing the single coherent source into two sources.
                                    This can be achieved by one of the following methods</p>
                                <p>1. by division of wave front, that is by taking (or considering) two secondary wavelets
                                        on the same wave front and superposing them</p>
                                <p>2. by division of amplitude, that is by separating the amplitude of single wave and
                                        reuniting them.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Newton’s ring interference is due to division of amplitude.</p>

                                <p align="center">Figure 6.1: Experimental setup of Newton’s ring</p>
                                <p>When light is incident on a thin film (thickness of the order of wave length of the incident 
                                    light), it suffers partial reflection and partial transmission at both upper as well as lower surfaces of the thin film. The transmitted light ray again suffers reflection at the lower surface. Interference occurs between the rays in the reflected and transmitted parts.</p>
                                <p>Similarly, in a wedge-shaped film, partial reflection as well as partial transmission also
                                    takes place. Moreover, the path difference changes from point to point which results into an interference fringe</p>
                                <p>Fig. 6.2 shows an wedge-shaped air film formed between the convex and plane glass
                                    plate inclined at an angle say θ. The refractive index of the film is μ. Ray AB is incident
                                    from a broad monochromatic source almost normally on the film. It suffers partial
                                    reflection (ray BE) and partial transmission (ray BC) on the convex surface. Ray BC
                                    again suffers partial reflection (ray CF) and partial transmission (not shown) on the plane
                                    surface at C.</p>
                                <p>The bright rings in the Newton’s ring, as shown in Fig. 6.3, are due to constructive
                                    interference between the reflected light rays BE and CF. The dark rings are caused by
                                    destructive interference between the same light rays BE and CF.</p>
                                <p>For a wedge-shaped thin film, the path difference between the rays BE and CF is
                                    given by</p>(6.6)
                                <p align="center">δ = 2μt cosα</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e5/5.2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p>
                                <p>Where t is the thickness of the film at B (or at D) and α is the angle of refraction at B.
                                    Since the angle of incidence is almost normal, we can assume cosα ~ 1. Note that here we ignore the reflections from top of the plano-convex lens and bottom of the plane circular glass plate since these reflections just contribute to the overall glare. The reflections of interest are only those involving the surfaces in contact.</p>
                                <p>Now by Stoke’s law, there is no phase change at the glass-air interface of the convex
                                    lens (because the wave is going from a higher to a lower refractive index medium), whereas
                                    the reflection at the air-glass interface of the plane glass plate undergoes an additional path
                                    difference of /2. Therefore, the net path difference is</p>(6.7)
                                    <p align="center"> δ + λ/2 = 2μt +λ/2</p>
                                    <p>Since for bright fringe, net path difference is nλ we have,</p>(6.8)
                                    <p align="center">  2μt = (2n + 1)λ/2</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, for dark fringe, the net path difference is (2n + 1)λ/2 and thus we have,</p>(6.9)
                                     <p align="center">  2μt = 2nλ</p>
                                     <p>At the centre, no reflection occurs since the two glass surfaces are in intimate contact 
                                        i.e. t = 0 or 2μt = 0. This is the condition for dark fringe. Hence the center of the pattern is always dark.</p>

                                     <p>In practice, it is not possible to find the exact centre of the bull’s eye in order to

                                        the interference ring. Therefore, substituting the value of t from Eq. 6.9, we obtain the

                              <br><h4><b>Apparatus Required :</b></h4>
                              <p>Newton’s ring microscope, sodium vapour lamp, circular slit plate, light emitting diode
                                    source</p>
                              <h4><b>Procedure</b></h4>
                              <p>1. The Newton’s ring microscope has two parts, (i) microscope with horizontal measurement
                                    and (ii) a Newton’s ring assembly. First detach the Newton’s ring assembly
                                    and clean the adjustable glass plate, plano-convex lens and its adjoining glass plate
                                    with a clean cloth.</p>
                             <p>2. Replace the plano-convex lens over the glass plate and tight them carefully with
                                    the help of three leveling screws (if present). An interference ring pattern can be
                                    observed with the naked eye.</p>   
                             <p>3. Arrange the Newton’s ring assembly as shown in Fig. 6.5. Note that the glass plate
                                    P' should be inclined at 45° with respect to the vertical plain.</p> 
                                <p>4. First connect the sodium vapour lamp power supply with mains. Then connect it
                                    with the light source box with the help of mains cord. Then switch ON the power supply.</p>
                                <p>5. Wait for 30 minutes till the lamp glow bright yellowish.</p>      
                                 <p>6. Insert circular slit plate into the slit-holder. Adjust to fully illuminate glass plate P'
                                        inclined at 45°.</p>
                                <p>7. Calculate the least count of the traveling microscope (M). If p is the pitch of the
                                        micrometer screw in cm, and m is the number of divisions on the circular scale, then
                                        least count is p/m in cm.</p>
                                <p>8. Take a view through the eye piece of the tube as shown in Fig. 6.6.</p>
                                <p>9. There are two type of movements provided in the microscope, coarse and fine. Align
                                    the microscope tube, with the help of coarse movement knob nos. 2 and 4 as shown in Fig. 6.6, to bring it over the glass plate P'.</p>

                                 <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e5/5.4.jpg" style="width: 20%;"></p>
                                 <p align="center">Figure 6.6: Experimental setup of Newton’s ring showing the screws</p>
                                 <p>10. Now move the microscope tube with the help of fine movement knob no. 3 close to
                                        the plate P' to obtain clear image of surface. Slowly move towards upward direction.
                                        Newton’s rings pattern is observed. Adjust by moving the microscope to and fro, if
                                        necessary, to view the full pattern. Adjust further for better contrast between bright
                                        and dark fringes.</p>
                                <p>11. Bring the cross-wire, using knob no. 1 shown in Fig. 6.6, in the central fringe such
                                            that their centre should coincide with each other.</p>
                                <p>12. Slide the cross-wire to the left till the vertical cross-wire line lies tangentially at the
                                    20th ring. Note the reading on the main and circular scale using the light emitting diode</p>
                                <p>13. Now slowly slide the microscope to the right and note the reading when the vertical
                                        cross-wire lies tangentially at the 16th, 12th, 8th and 4th rings respectively.</p>
                                <p>14. Keep sliding the microscope to the right and again note the readings when the vertical
                                        cross-wire lies tangentially at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th rings respectively.</p>

                                <p>15. The radius of curvature (R) of the plano-convex lens is 100 cm which can be calculated
                                        using the following formula</p>(6.13)

                                <p>16. Plot the graph D^2 as a function of n. This should be a straight line passing through the 
                                    origin (See Eq. 6.12)</p>
                                <p>17. Find the slope of the line from the graph.</p>
                                <p>18. Find the wavelength of sodium light from this slope using Eq. 6.12.</p>
