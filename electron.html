                                <p>Determining the value of specific charge e/m of an electron by Thomson Method</p><br>
                                <h4><b>Theory :</b></h4>
                                <p>In this method, a cathode ray tube is used in which the cathode emits electrons and the
                                    anode accelerates them and passes them through a small hole, to another anode which
                                    concentrates them into a fine beam. Then they are passed between two parallel plates,
                                    which can deflect the beam in a vertical plane by an electric field E applied between both
                                    the plates. The beam of electrons can also be deflected in the same plane by applying a
                                    magnetic field B perpendicular to the plane of plates. This narrowed collimated beam of
                                    accelerated electrons then strikes the fluorescent screen to produce a glowing spot. Three
                                    terms arise as follows:
                                </p>
                                <p>1. If an electric field E is applied by a potential difference of V volts between the plates,
                                      the electrons experience a force Fe in a direction perpendicular to the direction of
                                      motion of the beam.</p>(3.1)
                                <p align="center">Fe = Ee</p>
                                <p>2. If B is the uniform magnetic field applied in an horizontal direction perpendicular
                                      to the direction of the electron beam, the magnetic force Fmag experienced by the
                                      electrons is</p>(3.2)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e2/e2.1.jpg"></p>
                                <p>where e is the electron charge and v is the velocity of the electrons. This force
                                    Fmag acts perpendicular to the direction of B as well as in the original direction
                                    of electron motion (in accordance with Fleming’s left rule for electric motor). The
                                    speed of electrons remains unchanged, but their path becomes circular, providing
                                    the centripetal force</p>(3.3)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e2/e2.2.jpg"></p>
                                <p>where m is the mass of an electron and r is the radius of the circular path. Thus</p>(3.4)
                                <p align="center">e/m = v/Br</p>
                                <p>3. If an electric field E is applied to deflect the beam in OO' direction (see Fig. 3.1),
                                    then a magnetic field B is applied to bring beam back to O. It means that the force of
                                    the electrostatic field is equal and opposite to applied magnetic field, so Fe = Fmag,
                                    and two forces null each other to bring the beam back to its original position. Thus</p>(3.5)

                                <p>According to Fig.3.1, the original electron beam proceeds on the straight path G, M,
                                    O and impresses upon the screen at a point O. In the presence of magnetic field, the beam
                                    travels along a circular arc G, D whose radius is r. Beyond point D, the beam leaves the
                                    magnetic field and proceeds straight in the direction along the tangent KDO' (drawn on
                                    the circular arc at point D). GN is normal to GKO and MDN is normal to KDO'. Let
                                    these normals meet at point N. Then GN = ND = r = the radius of the circular arc. Let
                                    the angles GND = OKO' = θ. Then in the triangle KOO',</p>(3.7)

                                <p>where L is distance of the screen from the mid point of the magnetic field region (generally
                                    mid point of electric field too). Again,</p>(3.9)

                                <p>since GD is nearly equal to GM, or</p>(3.10)

                                <p>If a potential difference of V volts is applied between the plates P-P, and d is the gap
                                    between both plates, then the electric field is given by E = V/d. Therefore,</p>(3.14)

                              <p>Deflection magnetometer, two bar magnets, cathode ray oscilloscope, stand arrangement.</p>
                              <h4><b>Procedure :</b></h4>
                              <p>1. Using compass needle, find and note North-South and East-West directions. Place
                                  CRT in between the stand in such a way that its screen is faced towards North and
                                  both arms stand to East-West direction.</p>
                              <p>2. Adjust the Intensity and Focus potentiometer to its mid position.</p>
                              <p>3. Connect the CRT to octal socket of instrument (socket provided upon the panel).
                                    Care should be taken while inserting CRT plug.</p>
                              <p>4. Keep instrument to south direction far from CRT.</p>
                              <p>5. Select polarity selector switch at '0' position</p>
                              <p>6. Set the deflection voltage potentiometer at anti-clockwise direction.</p>
                              <p>7. Switch on the power supply and wait for some time (3-5 minutes) to warm up the
                                    CRT. A bright spot appears on the screen.</p>
                              <p>8. Adjust intensity and focus controls to obtain a sharp spot.</p>
                              <p>9. Bring the spot at the middle position of the CRT with the help of X-plate deflection
                                  voltage pot given at the back-side of the instrument.</p>
                              <p>10. Set polarity selector to ‘+’ position, and adjust deflection voltage to deflect the spot
                                  1 cm away towards upward. Note the deflection voltage from the meter as V1 and

                              <p>11. Now place the bar magnets (on the stand arm) to both sides of CRT such that their

                              <p>12. Adjust position of magnets to get spot back downward to original position.</p>
                              <p>13. Note the distances of bar magnet (poles facing the screen) as r1 and r2 from the

                              <p>14. Now remove magnets from the arms of stand.</p>
                              <p>15. Select ‘−’ position of polarity switch. Apply DC voltage to deflect the spot 1 cm away
                                    in downward direction. Note deflection voltage from display as V2 and deflection as
                                    y.</p>
                              <p>16. Place bar magnets again and adjust the position of magnets to bring spot back to
                                      original position. Note the distance of the magnets (poles facing the screen) as r1'
                                      and r2'.</p>
                              <p>17. Remove CRT and magnets. Place magnetometer arrangement in between the stand
                                      such that its centre lies on the center of the stand arm.
                                      Note: Position of stand should not be disturbed.</p>
                              <p>18. Rotate magnetometer and adjust the needle to read 0° − 0°.</p>
                              <p>19. Now place magnets at a distance equal to r1 and r2 as previous polarity adjusted.
                                    The pointer deflects along the scale. Note the deflections as θ1 and θ2.</p>
                              <p>20. Repeat similar procedure placing magnets at r1' and r2' distances. Note the deflection

                              <p><h4><b>Precaution :</b></h4></p>
                              <p>1. The cathode ray tube should be handled carefully. There should not be any magnetic
                                    substance nearby the place of experiment.</p>
                                  <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e2/2.10.jpg"></p>
                                  <p align="center"> Figure 3.2: Set-up of Thomson Method experiment </p>
                                  <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e2/2.11.jpg" style="width: 700px;"></p>

                              <p>2. Axis of magnets and axis of tube should lie perpendicular to each other in same
                                    horizontal plane. To correct it, loosen the neck clamp of CRT and rotate CRT so
                                    the spot deflects right up/down with deflection voltage.</p>
                              <p>3. When magnets are placed upon the arms, it is better to move stand slightly back
                                    and forth to obtain maximum magnetic field at deflecting plates. It should be done
                                    before bringing spot back to original position.</p>
                              <p>4. Rotate magnet(s) on their axes if spot does not come back to its original position.</p>
                              <p>5. When direction of spot is reversed the direction of magnets should also be reversed.</p>
                              <p>6. The magnets should move tight to the scale in closest possible distances.</p>
                              <p>7. The electric field between plates cannot be uniform due to short distance between
                                    them.</p>
                              <p>8. The given constants are generally taken from data; there may be slight variations to
                                    produce error.</p>
