                                <h4><b>Theory :</b></h4>
                                <p>The fact that a prism is capable of dispersing light is due to the variation of its refractive
                                    index with wavelength. In this experiment the refractive index is obtained for a variety of
                                    wavelengths by measuring the minimum deviation angle of the prism for each wavelength.</p>
                                
                                <p>To understand what is meant by the term angle of minimum deviation, consider Fig.
                                    5.1. The incident parallel light beam is refracted by the prism in such a way that it is
                                    deviated by the angle θd from the undeviated direction. The angle is known as the angle
                                    of deviation and varies with both the wavelength and the angle at which the incident light
                                    intersects the prism.</p>
                                <p>If the prism is rotated about the axis it is found that the angle of deviation changes but
                                    never becomes less than a certain minimum value, δmin known as the angle of minimum
                                    deviation i.e. no matter what the orientation of the prism, as long as it is in the path of the
                                    incident light beam, the light beam will be deviated through at least this angle. When the
                                    prism is oriented in such a way that the exit beam is deviated through the least possible
                                    angle δmin, then further rotation of the prism in either direction will cause the exit beam
                                    to move further away from the least deviated direction. Thus for each wavelength in a
                                    spectral light source, there is a variation of the angle of deviation, θd with the angle of
                                    incidence, θi and at some value of the angle of incidence, the angle of deviation reaches a
                                    minimum as seen in Fig. (5.3).</p>

                                <p>by measuring δmin for a variety of wavelengths, the variation of μ with wavelength may
                                    be determined.</p>
                                <p>To derive the exact relationship, consider the prism as seen in Fig. (5.4). It can be
                                    shown that the minimum value of the angle of deviation, δmin occurs when the ray passes
                                    through the prism symmetrically i.e. when the angle at which the light emerges is equal
                                    to the angle of incidence such that the ray passes parallel to the base of the prism as in
                                    Fig. (5.4). At each face the ray changes direction by θi − θr and so the total minimum
                                    deviation is</p>(5.1)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e4/4.3.jpg"></p>
                                <p> From Fig. 5.4, it is shown that the angle 6 MNO is the same as that of the refracting
                                    angle of the prism. Referring to the triangle LMN it is obvious, using trigonometry, that
                                    A = 2θr. Snell’s Law is of course μ = sin θi/ sin θr but θi = θmin/2 + θr, where θr = A/2
                                    and hence we have</p>(5.2)

                              <p>results the spectroscope requires some initial adjustments before the desired measurements
                                    can be performed. For this experiment great care must be taken in adjusting the spectrometer so that the telescope is focused at infinity and the collimator set to give an
                                    accurately parallel beam. It is particularly important to ensure that the cross-hairs of the
                                    telescope are sharply visible and that no parallax exists between them and the spectral
                                    line images. The following steps should ensure this:</p>
                                <p>1. Focusing the telescope: Focus the telescope for the parallel rays from the distance
                                        object by sliding the eyepiece looking through telescope in and out, until a sharp
                                        image of object is seen. Due to the location of the laboratory this may not be possible
                                        so the building opposite may be used for this purpose.</p>  
                                <p>2. Levelling the collimator: Place the spirit level on the collimator tube with its axis
                                        parallel to the axis of the tube. If the the bubble in the collimator is found to
                                        be displaced from its central position, turn the levelling screws provided with the
                                        collimator tube, in the same direction to bring the bubble back to its central position.
                                        This make the axis of the collimator tube horizontal.</p>
                                <p>3. Levelling of the prism table: There are three levelling screws A, B, C just below
                                        the prism table for levelling the table. There are parallel lines drawn on the prism
                                        table parallel to the line joining the screws B and C. Place the spirit level parallel
                                        to these lines and bring the bubble to the central position by turning the screws B
                                        and C equally in opposite directions. Now place the spirit level perpendicular to the

                                        bring the bubble in the center. Continue this for a couple of times until the bubble
                                        is in the center in both the positions. This makes the table vertical to the axis of
                                        rotation.</p>    
                                <p>4. Focusing the collimator: Place a discharge lamp (Mercury lamp as a visible light
                                        source) in front of the spectroscope and turn the telescope until it is in line with and
                                        pointing directly at the collimator. Looking through the telescope and adjusting the
                                        position of the focusing screw on the collimeter until a sharp image of the slit is
                                        observed in the telescope. The collimeter now gives parallel rays which will fall on
                                        the prism.</p>

                                <h5><b>Measurement of the angle of prism (A)</b></h5>
                                <p>1. Set up the prism and spectrometer as in Fig. (5.6). Lock the prism table.</p>
                                <p>2. Place the telescope cross-hairs in turn on the image of the slit reflected from surface
                                        AB and then surface AC.</p>
                                <p>3. At each position record the angular position of the telescope on the vernier scalethe
                                    angle between the two positions of the telescope is 2A, twice the apex angle of
                                    the prism and hence A can be found.</p>
                                <p>4. Repeat above step 2 and 3 to get an average value for A(~60°).</p>

                                <h5><b>Viewing the spectrum due to refraction</b></h5>
                                <p>The telescope and prism are rotated until the spectrum formed by refraction is found.
                                    The approximate prism position is shown in Fig. 5.7.</p>
                                <p>Further rotation of the prism while viewing the spectrum through the telescope will
                                    result in reaching the angle of minimum deviation. This is where the spectral lines “turn
                                    back" on themselves i.e. move opposite to their initial direction of travel while the prism
                                    is still being rotated in the same direction.</p>
                                <p>Position the prism and telescope so that the spectral lines are at the angle of minimum
                                    deviation i.e. at the point where the spectral lines “turn back" on themselves.</p>
                                <p>Position the prism and telescope so that the spectral lines are at the angle of minimum
                                    deviation i.e. at the point where the spectral lines “turn back" on themselves.</p>
                                <p>Turning the prism towards the telescope, increases the angle of incidence, thus moving
                                    to the right hand side of δmin in the curve of Fig. (5.3). Conversely turning the prism
                                    towards the collimator, decreases the angle of incidence, hence moving through the angle
                                    of minimum deviation to the left hand side of the curve of Fig. 5.3.</p>


                                <h5><b>Measurement of the angle of minimum deviation, δmin for each wavelength</b></h5>
                                <p>1. Using the Hg spectral lamp, observe the first order field of view of refracted spectrum.
                                        Find the point of minimum deviation for the Hg spectrum. The approximate
                                        prism position is as shown in Fig. 5.7.</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e4/4.12.jpg"></p>
                                <p align="center">Figure 5.7: Prism position for viewing the spectrum due to refraction</p>
                                 <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e4/4.13.jpg"></p>
                                <p align="center">Table 5.1: Discharge lamp wavelengths</p> 
                                <p>(Remember minimum deviation corresponds to the point at which movement of the
                                    lines of the Hg spectrum over the field of view of the telescope is reversed, although
                                    direction of rotation of the telescope continues in the same sense.)</p>
                                <p>2. Several spectral lines should be in the field of view of the telescope. Position the
                                        telescope on the highest wavelength spectral line and lock the prism table and telescope.
                                        It is essential that the prism and prism table remain in this position for the
                                        remainder of the experiment</p>
                                <p>3. Using the telescope fine adjustment screw, position the crosshairs of the telescope
                                    accurately on the spectral line of interest and read the vernier to the nearest minute
                                    of arc</p>
                                <p>4. The above step can be repeated for the other lines in the field of view of the telescope
                                    there should be enough movement in the telescope fine adjustment screw to allow positioning of the cross-hairs on all of the Hg spectral lines of Table 5.1 without unlocking the telescope again. If this is not the case, just unlock the telescope and reposition it such that the crosshairs of the eyepiece are on the spectral line of interest. It is imperative that the prism and prism table remain in their original fixed position.</p>
                                <p>5. Rotate the telescope anticlockwise until the undeviated image of the slit through the
                                        prism is in the field of view. Again position the crosshairs on the centre of the clit
                                        image and record the angular reading of the telescope on the vernier scale.</p>
                                <p>6. The actual value for δmin for each wavelength is the difference between the appropriate
                                        angular reading of the telescope position for minimum deviation and for the
                                        undeviated (straight through) position as seen in Fig. (5.1)</p>
