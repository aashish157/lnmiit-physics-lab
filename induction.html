                                <p>Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction tells us that a change in magnetic flux gives
                                    rise to an induced emf " given by</p>(8.1)

                                <p>where φ is the magnetic flux. A simple apparatus has been designed, whose schematic</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e7/7.7.1png.jpg" style="width: 35%;"></p>
                                 <p align="center">Figure 8.1: Schematic of the coil moving in and out of the magnetic field.</p>
                                <p>diagram is shown in Fig. (8.1), enables us to change θ at different rates through a coil of
                                     suitable area of cross-section. A rigid semicircular frame of aluminium is pivoted at the
                                    centre of the semicircle. The whole frame can oscillate freely in its own plane, about a
                                    horizontal axis passing through its centre. A bar magnet can be mounted at the centre of
                                    the arc and the arc passes through a coil C.</p>
                               
                                <p>It is very instructive to study the emf, induced in the coil as the magnet passes through
                                    the coil while oscillating. In this experiment we will use a computer to monitor emf induced
                                    as a function of time.</p>
                                <p>The rate of change of flux through the coil is essentially proportional to the velocity
                                    of the magnet, as it passes through the coil. Choosing different amplitudes of oscillations
                                    can vary the velocity.</p>
                                <p>If I is the moment of inertia of the oscillatory system and ω is the angular velocity of
                                    the magnet, then the kinetic energy of the system is Iω^2/2 and potential energy can be
                                    represented by MgL(1 − cosθ) at any instant of time, where L is the effective length of
                                    the corresponding simple pendulum. If θo is the maximum angular amplitude and ωmax
                                    is the maximum value of angular velocity, then</p>(8.2)

                              <p>1. <b>Charging of capacitor to obtain</b> εmax
                                    The induced emf can be measured by using a simple circuit as shown in Fig. 8.2.
                                    The induced emf in the coil charges a capacitor C, through a resistance R and a
                                    diode D and the voltage developed across C is measured by voltmeter V . The diode
                                    current can flow only if the voltage at A is greater than B. Thus once a capacitor
                                    attains a voltage ", current can flow through the capacitor only if the induced emf is
                                    greater than ". If the time constant RC is not small compared to the time taken for
                                    the magnet to cross the coil, the capacitor does not get fully charged in AC signal
                                    oscillation. It may take several oscillations to do so.</p>
                                <p>Connect a resistor, diode and a capacitor given to you in series with the coil. Observe
                                    the signal across resistor, diode and the capacitor as a function of time</p>
                              <p>Calculate vmax using Eq. (8.5) and plot a graph between "max vs vmax. "max is the
                                    maximum potential obtained in the CRO.</p>

                                        obtain flux φ as a function of time. You can integrate only half of the pulse,

                                    <p>Note that when the magnet is at its mean position, then ω = ωmax or velocity
                                        is at its maximum since Vmax = ωmax R. However, dφ/dθ = 0 at that point.
                                        Hence emf will go through a zero corresponding to the mean position. Also
                                        note that</p>(8.7)

                                        max would be linear. The proportionality constant depends only on the geometry of the coil and the magnet. For calculating φ use “Show integral" mode as before.</p>

                                    due to damping. Possible sources are: (i) air resistance, (ii) friction at the point of
                                    suspension, and (iii) induced emf (Lenz’s law).</p>
                                <p>The system (for small ) and for damping proportional to velocity would satisfy the
                                    equation.</p>(8.8)

                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e7/7.3.jpg" style="width: 30%;"></p>
                                <p>where I is moment of inertia about origin, k is damping coefficient and λ0 is restoring
                                        couple (Mgl0), if treated as a simple pendulum of length 1.</p>
                                <p>The amplitude would exponentially decay only if k is a constant and damping term
                                        depends linearly in velocity. Record a large number of oscillations starting from
                                        initial amplitude of 300 to study the damping behaviour in the absence of induced
                                        current in the coil. The plot seen on the screen may not be correct representation of
                                        data since the number of points to be plotted is too large. Therefore divide the time
                                        axis to approximately 8 to 10 zones and take data after magnifying 1 pulse from each
                                        zone. Plot ωmax and (dω/dt)(vmax) as a function of time or number of oscillations.
                                        From your data calculate Q of this oscillator using A = Aoert/2 and Q = ωo/r.</p>

                                <p>Now, connect a resistor of about 220
                                    (the coil resistance is around 900) in series with the coil and record voltage dropped across the resistor as a function of time (for large number of oscillations as in the previous case). Repeat analysis of data as above.</p>

                                <p>4. <b>Useful features of the software measure:</b></p>
                                <p>It is easy to use the software given to you. Take a few minutes to summarize yourself
                                    with it before going to the detailed experiments. All you have to do is to click the
                                    required icon given at the top. Some of the important ones are as follows:</p>
                                <p>ARROW: In this mode simply point the cursor at the required point to obtain
                                            values of the coordinates.</p>
                                <p>MARK: Use this mark a portion of the curve. The x-coordinate of the mark portion
                                        are shown on the bottom. The marked portion is highlighted in a different
                                        colour.
                                <p>SURVEY: You can adjust the left bottom and right top coordinates of the cursor
                                    box to obtain coordinates and their differences in this mode. You can use this
                                    to calculate slopes around a point.</p>
                                <p>SHOW INTEGRAL: Mark the portion of the curve for which you need to calculate
                                    the integral and then click this icon to obtain the value. If you need to start
                                    from the origin, each time, take the cursor out of the plotting area and drag it
                                    across the origin to ensure that starting point is the same.</p>
                                <p>SLOPE: Mark the required portion of the curve for which you need the slope and
                                    then click this icon to get slope. However, we recommend use of survey mode
                                    to get slope more accurate.</p>
