                                <h4><b>Theory :</b></h4>
                                <h5><b>Preliminary discussion:</b></h5>
                                <p>Interference refers to the interaction of two or more wave trains of light having the same 
                                    frequency and having a phase difference which remains constant with time (coherent sources), so that they may combine with the result that the energy is not distributed uniformly in space but is a maximum at certain points and a minimum (perhaps zero) at others.</p>(8.1)
                                
                                <p>Diffraction phenomenon is described as the apparent bending of waves around small
                                    obstacles and the spreading out of waves past small openings. Diffraction patterns are
                                    marked by a rapid decrease in intensity with increasing distance from the center of the
                                    pattern.</p>
                                
                                <p>A diffraction grating is made by making many parallel scratches on the surface of a
                                    flat piece of transparent material. It is possible to put a large number of scratches per
                                    centimeter on the material, e.g., the grating to be used has 6000 lines/cm on it. The
                                    scratches are opaque but the areas between the scratches can transmit light. Thus, a
                                    diffraction grating becomes a multitude of parallel slit sources when light falls upon it.</p>

                                <h5><b>Diffraction grating equation</b></h5>
                               
                                <p>When parallel bundle of rays falls on the grating, these rays and their associated wave
                                    fronts form an orthogonal set so the wave fronts are perpendicular to the rays and parallel
                                    to the grating (as shown in Fig. 11.1). According to Huygens’ Principle, every point on a
                                    wave front acts like a new source, each transparent slit becomes a new source so cylindrical
                                    wave fronts spread out from each. These wave fronts interfere either constructively or
                                    destructively depending on how the peaks and valleys of the waves are related.</p>
                                <p>Whenever the difference in path length between the light passing through different slits
                                    is an integral number of wavelengths of the incident light, the light from each of these slits will be in phase, and then it will form an image at the specified location. Mathematically,
                                    the relation is simple</p>(11.1)
                                    <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e10/10.1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p>
                                <p>Eq. (11.1) is known as grating equation. The light that corresponds to direct transmission</p>
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e10/10.2.jpg" style="width: 20%;"></p>
                                <p>(or specular reflection in the case of a reflection grating) is called the zero order, and is
                                    denoted m = 0. The other maxima occur at angles which are represented by non-zero
                                    integers m. Note that m can be positive or negative, resulting in diffracted orders on both
                                    side of the zero order beam.</p>
                                <p>Diffraction gratings are often used in monochromators, spectrometers, lasers, wavelength
                                    division multiplexing devices, optical pulse compressing devices, and many other
                                    optical instruments.</p>

                                  <h5><b>Resolving power of grating</b></h5>
                                  <p>This equation then leads to the following expression for the resolving power of the diffraction
                                        grating</p>(11.2)
                                <p align="center"> R = λ/δλ = mN</p>
                                <p>Here λ  is the average of wavelength, δλ  is the difference between wavelengths, m is the order  
                                    and N is the total number of slits on the grating. Thus, the distance between maxima depends on the distance between slits and the resolution,the relative sharpness of the maxima, depends on the total number of slits. (Often a grating is characterized by the number of slits per unit length. From this information one can, of course, deduce the distance between the slits..</p>

                              <p>As with many optical instruments, the spectroscope requires some initial adjustments
                                    before the desired measurements can be performed. Focusing and levelling of the spectrometer
                                    for the parallel rays is to be done as per previous prism experiment.</p>

                                <p><b>To set the telescope axis perpendicular to that of the collimator:</b></p>
                              <p>Illuminate the slit with the light source. Turn the telescope of the spectrometer to view the
                                    image of the illuminated slit directly as shown in Fig. 11.3(a). The source should directly
                                    be in front of the slit such that maximum light falls on the slit. Adjust the cross-wires
                                    such that the image of the slit falls in the middle of the intersection of the cross-wires.
                                    Fix the prism table with the fixing screw and read any of the two verniers. Let this angle
                                    be α. Rotate the telescope by an amount 90 ± α such that it is exactly perpendicular to the collimator. Fix the telescope in this position and unfix the prism table.</p>
                              <p> Fix the grating (G) in the grating holder such that the grating lines are perpendicular
                                    to the prism table and the ruled surface extend equally on both sides of the center. The
                                    grating is set parallel to the line joining the prism table screws B and C as shown in
                                    Fig. 11.3. Turn the prism table such that light from the collimator is reflected into the
                                    telescope. The reflection should be by the unruled surface of the grating. To determine
                                    the unruled surface use the following procedure. Allow light to be reflected by both the
                                    grating surface one at a time and view the corresponding image via the telescope. The
                                    surface from which the image of the slit appears sharper is in fact the unruled surface of
                                    the grating</p>
                               <p >Once the unruled surface has been determined, view the reflection only via the unruled
                                    surface while the setup is as shown in Fig. 11.3(b). If the center of the grating displace
                                    either above or below the intersection of the cross-wires, then the grating surface is not
                                    vertical. To ensure that the grating surface is vertical, turn the prism table screws B and C
                                    equally in opposite directions until the center of the image coincides with the intersection
                                    of the cross-wires</p>
                                <p>Turn the unruled surface of the grating by an angle 45° such that the light from the
                                    collimator falls normally on the unruled surface of the grating. Fix the prism table in this
                                    position and unfix the telescope.</p>
                                <p>Even though we have made the plane of the grating vertical and the rulings perpendicular

                                <h4><b>Caution</b></h4>
                                <p>1. The diffraction grating is a photographic reproduction and should NOT be touched.
                                    Make sure that the glassy base of grating shouldn’t faces towards the source light.</p>
                                <p>2. Now your setup is ready to report the experimental observations.</p>                      
                              <p><h4><b>Observations :</b></h4></p>
                              <p >1. Check to make sure that the grating is not too high or low relative to the collimator.
                                    Affirm maximum brightness for the straight through beam by adjusting the source
                                    slit alignment. At this step, the slit should be narrow, perhaps a few times wider
                                    than the hairline. Search for the spectrum by moving the telescope to one side or
                                    the other. This spectrum should look much like the visible spectrum observed with
                                    the prism. This is the first order spectrum. Record for each color diffraction angle
                                    θR (along right side) and θL (along left side) from the straight trough beam.</p>
                              <p >2. For each of the seven colors in the mercury spectrum, measure the angles R and L
                                    to the nearest tenth of a degree by placing the hairline on the stationary side of the
                                    slit. </p>
                                <p>3. You are expected to observe the 1st order diffraction pattern.</p>
                                <p>4. From your observations calculate various wavelengths of visible radiations from the
                                        mercury source</p>

                                <p><h4><b>Calculation</b></h4></p>
                                <p>1. Use the grating equation with d = (1/6000) cm to find the wavelength  for each
                                    colour.</p>
                                <p>2. Calculate % error for your reported λ measurement.</p>

                              <p>3. What could be causing any discrepancy?</p>
                              <p>4. Why is it necessary that the base side of the grating face toward the light source?
                                    Draw a ray diagram for the two cases:</p>
                                <p>a) Base toward the source (correct).</p>
                                <p> b) Grating toward the source (incorrect).</p>
                               <p>5. Mention your special comments for each statement in your lab report as a part of
